🌍 Earthquake Alert System

The *Earthquake Alert System* is an educational Java application that simulates real-world *seismic monitoring* and *emergency notification* systems.  
It is designed to showcase *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

🚀 Features
- Automatic earthquake detection & severity classification:
  - Critical / High / Medium / Low  
- Multi-channel alerts:
  - SMS, Email, Emergency Services  
- Subscriber management  

🛠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- *Inheritance* – Extendable alert channels & earthquake types  
- *Polymorphism* – Different behaviors for severity levels  
- *Abstraction* – Interfaces for alert systems  
- *Encapsulation* – Safe handling of data  
- *Composition* – Collaboration between objects  

🎯 Purpose
This project is *ideal for*:
- Students learning Java and OOP  
- Developers building *portfolio-ready projects*  
- Educators demonstrating practical OOP concepts
